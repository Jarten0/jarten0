## Welcome to scenic my profile!
I'm currently in the process of starting my career in the industry of programming, and am excited to get the opportunity to be here.

I have many a project that I've poured many an hour into, in many different programming languages.
A ton of them are involved in game programming, since that's what I find most enjoyable.

I've used a ton of Rust because I adore type system and especially the iterator pattern, 
and enjoy the almost artistic form of solving down data models into their most turse form.
The ecosystem is also great, all of the tools I've used work wonderously, especially where
the data model is in it's most simplified machine-level form, at least as much as memory-safe programming languages get.

I also use C# where Rust fails, particularly when avoiding Rust's lifetime marking and dis-ease of use.
It's nice to be able to work in a language that doesn't require a ton of effort to do the same things with,
but I do sorely miss all of the low level purity and don't particularly enjoy working with
the comparitively high level abstractions that feel inefficient to even use. It's what gets the job done though,
so I stick with it.

The next language I want to learn is C++ since it should hopefully be great for all of the reasons that I enjoy
working with Rust and perhaps have a few strengths of working with C#. I have no plans for anything involved 
with it at the moment unfortunately, but if you, the reader, have anything pertaining to it, please reach out.
I'd love to be able to learn the rest of the low level tooling, and be able to bring that skillset to the rest of
the game development environemt or other areas that would benefit from it.

Reach out if you want to know more about what I do. I would love to talk about anything I've worked on.
