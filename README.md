## Welcome to scenic my profile!
I'm currently in the process of starting my career in the industry of programming, and am excited to get the opportunity to be here.

I have many a project that I've poured many an hour into, in many different programming languages.
A ton of them are involved in game programming, since that's what I find most enjoyable.

Reach out if you want to know more about what I do. I would love to talk about anything I've worked on.
